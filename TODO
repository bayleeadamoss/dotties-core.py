Working tree problem:
If we have 3 projects that are linked together, during a `dotties update` the
second one fails it could leave the user in a weird state and possibly unable to
use their editor of choice (vim obviously).

To fix this, we need to ensure a fetch/merge will work correctly on each repo
before we do an actual merge, as described by this pseudo code:

~~~
if ! git fetch origin
  fail
else
  if dirty_branch?
    fail
  else
    rm -rf ../.test_merge_dir
    git worktree add -b test ../.test_merge_dir
    if git merge
      success
    else
      fail
~~~
